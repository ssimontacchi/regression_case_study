# regression_case_study
Used linear regression, LASSO, Ridge regressions and more to predict sale prices using extremely messy dataset.

This dataset was presented to us as our first case study at Galvanize, with the goal of using linear regression 
to accurately predict vehicle sale prices.

For most of the 54 features, there were enormous amounts of missing data, resulting in much data cleaning first
and then analysis with many different models.
